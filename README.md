const discover = new MdnsDiscovery()

discover.announce('mdns-basic-example', { port: 3456 })
```

### Look up a service

  console.log('found service:', service)
})

discover.lookup('mdns-basic-example')
```

If you see `Error: Timed out getting default route` when using with nodejs versions >=18.0.0 to <18.4.0, upgrade to at least 18.4.0 to resolve this.
